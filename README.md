# tech-stack
This repo should contain a projects with a  stack of best-practice tools and technologies.

The tools that should appear in the project:
Python - as a main language
Django - as a main web framework
DRF - to get access to others
Nginx - web-server
Docker - to get the setup in place
Kuber - to manage different apps 
Postgres - main db
ElasticSearch - shoud think about how to use it (maybe parse something and search through it?)
AWS - to run the services in the cloud
Linux(Cent os Debian) - as a main OS
Git - to manage the code (should ask someone to contribute and make conflicts)
Grafana - to visualise proccesses and ram/cpu etc.

Optional:
Redis
Mongo
Clickhouse
Ansible
Google Cloud
Azure (maybe divide some tasks for three cloud providers to gain exp in all of them)
Vue/Angular/React
Airflow
Prometheus
Neo4j

Also the project should seem real, so there has to be:
Atlassian Jira, Confluence, Trello etc.
Some users to administrate them and express collaboration proccess
VPN configs to every member of a team
Dashboards

Under construction...
